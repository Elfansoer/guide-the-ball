# Guide The Ball

## How to play
1. Use your mouse to pull the string attached to the ball.
2. The ball can gain or lose mass after taking foods. More mass means more momentum.
3. The string has maximum stretch length. Be careful to keep distance.
4. Game ends when the string stretched too far and snapped.
